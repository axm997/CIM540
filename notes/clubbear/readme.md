Club Bear

Welcome to Club Bear! This website allows users to mix and match their own bear with fun college shirts, locations, music, and more!

1. I made Club Bear for users who may remember websites like Webkinz or Club Penguin and want to experience the nostalgia again. Club Bear is also open to anyone, old or young, who enjoys the fun of interactive media and animated characters.

2. My motivation for this project was to recreate Club Penguin college edition as most of the users have grown up and may even be in college. I wanted to bring back a fun memory from my own childhood.

3. My inputs are the start button, outfits changes, locations transports, and the club bear button.  
4. My outputs are music and pawphone lights.

5. My target audience is all ages who may remember similar websites from their childhood or just want to have fun interacting with an animated bear.

6. My project will be displayed on computers mostly but also is compatible with phones.
